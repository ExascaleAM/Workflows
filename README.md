# ExaAM Workflows

A number of workflows may exist for additive manufacturing processes. As our collections of workflows grow, the ExaAM project will provide examples of workflows here. Currently, we provide our uncertainty quantification workflow to model a location within the NIST AMBench-2018-01 part on Frontier. You can find this workflow in the `uq_workflow` directory along with directions related to how to run it.

Docker containers are provided for running these workflows and can be obtained with:

docker pull ghcr.io/ExascaleAM/Workflows/ubuntu:latest
